# Introduction

AutoMarkDoc is an open source solution designed to transform project documentation (written in Markdown) into a modern, responsive website. By leveraging Symfony and Bootstrap, AutoMarkDoc converts your Markdown files into a sleek, user-friendly documentation hub.
While many solutions exist, none fully matched our requirements of being **simple**, **not too ugly**, and **extremely quick** to set up—so we built AutoMarkDoc from scratch.

## Project Genesis

We initially discovered a wonderful template built with Tailwind CSS that inspired the final look and feel we wanted for our docs. However, we needed a solution that was **100% open source and completely free**—without any hidden licensing or subscription costs. Although Tailwind itself is free, certain design templates carry fees. We encourage those with available budgets to support premium templates, as they often provide a more polished user experience.

Ultimately, to keep AutoMarkDoc entirely free, we rewrote the template using the latest version of Bootstrap. By combining Symfony, Composer, and Bootstrap, AutoMarkDoc achieves the following goals:
1. **Minimal Setup Time:** A few commands are all it takes to have a working docs site.
2. **Cost-Free:** All source code is provided under an open licence, allowing anyone to use or modify it.
3. **Easy to Customize:** You can adapt the styles or even revert to the original template if desired.

## Why AutoMarkDoc?

1. **Reuse Existing Markdown**  
   Many open source projects already have documentation written in Markdown. AutoMarkDoc lets you plug those files right in, minimizing rework and speeding up deployment.

2. **Effortless Transformation**  
   Write your documentation in Markdown, and let AutoMarkDoc automatically generate a clean, organized site with no manual styling necessary.

3. **Streamlined Development**  
   Built on established technologies (Symfony framework). Simple installation and minimal disruption to your current workflow.

4. **Open Source Values**  
   Contributions and customizations are welcome. The community can help shape the project to meet diverse needs.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Bootstrap-Powered UI**  
  Enjoy a responsive, modern look that scales across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Enhanced Markdown Support**  
  Incorporates GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features—like admonitions (tips, notes, warnings), tabbed content, strikethroughs, and task lists—to make documentation more dynamic.

- **Straightforward Configuration**  
  Update essential settings—like logos, project names, or custom links—through a clear `config.yaml` file.

- **Easy Collaboration**  
  Works seamlessly within standard Git workflows. Your team can write and review docs via pull requests, just like any other code.

## Philosophy

AutoMarkDoc was born from the desire to have a **simple, appealing, and fast** documentation site generator without incurring recurring fees or complex licensing. Emphasizing a lean build process and clarity, AutoMarkDoc ensures that your content stays front and center—helping you maintain accessible, professional, and always up-to-date documentation for your project.
